A Shopping Cart App build with the MERN Stack

The frontend part is build with React JS with Ant Design.

A user needs to have an account to be able to order orders. When a user adds a product to his cart, the database gets immediately updated rather than just update in the frontend.

It also uses RAZORPAY for payment process and MAILGUN for password reset process. For Authentication Process I have used JWT which stores tokens in local storage of browsers. I have also used AWS S3 Bucket as well as local directory (static assets) for storing images..
