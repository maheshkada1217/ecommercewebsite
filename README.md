# e-cart61

A Shopping Cart App build with the MERN Stack

Techs used: AWS S3 Bucket, Mailgun, Razorpay

The frontend part is build with React JS with Ant Design.

A user needs to have an account to be able to order orders. When a user adds a product to his cart, the database gets immediately updated rather than just updating in the frontend.

It also uses RAZORPAY for payment process and MAILGUN for password reset process. For Authentication Process I have used JWT which stores tokens in local storage of browsers. I have also used AWS S3 Bucket as well as local directory (static assets) for storing images..

And yes it also has an admin side who can ADD, UPDATE and DELETE products/items and accept a customer order..
